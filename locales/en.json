I have worked with small to medium size companies and NGOs where I was able to add values to the organization through my expertise and skills. <br><br> Being passionate about technologies, I always want to learn new skills and work on projects that require me to reach outside of my comfort zone and knowledge. <br><br> When I am not working, I enjoy watching movies, listenning to music and helping people with technology challenges."
